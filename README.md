Here my various notes from my courses are stored. The notes are updated continuously during my studies, and some sections may be incomplete.

If you notice any errors, please make an issue here at Github. Since the source files are provided, I ask that I am credited if my work is continued upon.

Thank you for checking out my notes! :)
